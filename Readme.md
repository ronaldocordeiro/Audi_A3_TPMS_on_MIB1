This project addresses the problem of the lack of a fully compatible TPMS ECU for the MIB1 multimedia system installed in "pre facelift" (2013 to 2016) Audi A3/S3 8V models. It uses an Arduino board connected to two CAN Bus shields to read CAN Bus data sent from a  8S0907273 TPMS ECU and makes changes on the messages before they are sent to the car's CAN Bus, so that pressure and temperature data are correctly displayed on the MMI screen.
